# Introduction

Imagine tiny switches – transistors – like the alphabet of a secret code. Today, we crack that code, learning how to combine these switches into simple gates like AND, OR, and NOT. Then, like building words from letters, we'll use these gates to build amazing things: counters that keep track, adders that sum numbers, and even timers that tick away! Get ready to journey from the building blocks of electronics to mini-machines that work their magic – all from simple logic and a spark of imagination!

# [NOR gate](https://github.com/HorikitaSuzuneTsundere/Integrated-Circuits/tree/main/nor%20gate)

This project is all about making a "NOT-OR" machine, also known as a NOR gate, using building blocks: resistors and transistors. These tiny parts act like switches, letting us control electricity and perform cool logic tricks.

# [XOR gate](https://github.com/HorikitaSuzuneTsundere/Integrated-Circuits/tree/main/xor%20gate)

This project delves into the construction and operation of Exclusive-OR (XOR) gates using discrete components, specifically transistors, resistors, and diodes. This exploration aims to provide a hands-on understanding of fundamental digital logic circuits and their practical realization.
